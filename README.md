## How to Use the Rocket Knowledge Assistant

Look for the white box under the title.
This is where you type your rocket question.
Example: "How fast do rockets go?"

 * Type your question. Just use normal words—ask it like you're asking a friend.

 * Click the blue “Ask” button. It’s right next to the box.
   
 * Wait for the answer. The assistant will search for the best answer and show it to you.

 * Didn’t type anything? It will remind you to enter a question before clicking “Ask.”
